# Filename for target server keypair file. It can be useful in case
# you already had some OpenVPN PKI and now just want to migrate to the new
# version, so if you had OpenVPN server keys named after 'some.name.[key,crt]'
# and will set server_name var to 'some.name', your keys won't be regenerated
# and you will continue to use old ones.
server_name: localhost

# Hostname which clients should connect to. In case you will
# use it, exactly that name will be shown in client ovpn file as server to
# connect to, otherwise 'server_name' var will be used. Optional.
